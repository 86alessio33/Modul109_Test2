    <div class="cloud-heading">Cloud Deployment Models</div>
    <div class="cloud-description">
      Cloud deployment models define the ownership and accessibility of cloud infrastructure:
      <ul>
        <li>Public Cloud: Infrastructure is owned and operated by a third-party provider, accessible to the public.</li>
        <li>Private Cloud: Infrastructure is exclusively dedicated to a single organization, providing enhanced security and control.</li>
        <li>Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private cloud infrastructure, offering flexibility and data placement options.</li>
